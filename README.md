# SQL for Data Analysis
This repository stores my quiz answers for the 'SQL for Data Analysis' Udacity course. I created it only so I could more easily switch between my PC and laptop.

For reference, the database entity relationship diagram (ERD) for these lessons is given [here](quizes/database_ERD.png).
